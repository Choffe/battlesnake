# Rusty Snake

Rusty is a battle snake built with Rocket, a rust web developement framework.

## Note:

If you just want to use this as the starter snake run this command in the directory.

```
git checkout template
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to use and develope Rusty your going to need a few things:

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
2. [A very basic understanding of the web](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)
3. [A understanding of the game this bot is trying to play](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-server/#readme)

### Installing

Once your done with the basics copy and paste the command below into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/McRaeAlex/RustySnake.git
```

Then

```
cd RustySnake
git checkout template
cargo run
```
You should see something like this
```
Configured for development.
    => address: localhost
    => port: 8000
    => log: normal
    => workers: 8
    => secret key: generated
    => limits: forms = 32KiB
    => tls: disabled
ðŸ›°  Mounting '/':
    => GET /
    => POST /start
ðŸš€  Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000
```
if you don't and it gives you errors saying missing features or something about nightly, run:
```
rustup default nightly
```
to switch your default toolchain to nightly

to install nightly

```
rustup install nightly
```

To push it to your own repo

```
git push -u <your repo>
```

And your done!

## Running the tests:

Using the package manager bundled with rust run:

```
cargo test
```

## Deployment (TODO)

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
